								The website was recently revamped as the client wanted a fresh and modern look. I made mockups of the design and each page was tweaked with full client involvement and feedback until they were happy with it.
							</p>
							<p>
								The website lists their properties, has enquiry forms on the properties, favourites system so clients can have a shortlist of their favourite properties and has virtual tours and videos (depending what the client wishes to show). 
							</p>
							<p>
								The website is run by a fully bespoke CRM and CMS system which allows them to manage their clients, their client's requirements for properties, has full email functionality and weekly newsletters to the clients listing any new properties depending on requirements and XML feed imports and exports.
							</p>
							<p>
								The CRM solution helps the staff to focus less on admin and more on sales.
