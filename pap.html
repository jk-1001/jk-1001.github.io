								The website required a revamp using the same branded colours, the client had an idea of the design they wanted, they pitched their ideas to me and I came back with a concept which was then refined and tweaked until we were happy with it. The client also required a lot of control in their own content and SEO so a small bespoke backend CMS system was created to support the website and give the client full control. 
							</p>
							<p>The website also required that the users could get an online quote for their dogs and cats, the whole process can be done online and paid for via card or direct debit (using Stripe API), then all the relevant documents are generated and emailed to the client.</p>
							<p>The client was moving from an outdated custom CRM solution to Zoho's out of the box CRM solution, so it was required that I read through the documentation and integrate the Zoho API into the website so that all the client data is handled correctly.</p>
							<p>Due to the extraordinary vision of my client, this website, whilst fully functioning - will continue to be a work in progress & expansion. Since the original development was completed, I have implemented a fully integrated online claims system and a business directory for vets. To be continued...</p>
